# PepRally Android App

PepRally is a social app whose content is catered for college sports fans and college communities in general. In our media crazed society today, all types of media is thrown at us through numerous apps all day, every day. We often spend many minutes (if not hours) scrolling past irrelevant content to the ones that actually matter to us. Thus a niche social media platform is very much desired, especially for young, creative individuals craving to express themselves in unique ways (aka. college students) and trying to identify themselves in the biggest social group of all (aka. colleges).

PepRally will be centered around sports primarily where users can browse teams, rosters and have the ability to send virtual "fistbumps" to players and other users to raise school spirit and to create an environment where fans come together and cheer for their team. PepRally will also give users the ability to share media posts (text/image/video) to the community and can be fistbumped (upvoted) by others. Moreover, users can send direct fistbumps to each other if they fancy each other's content and if a mutual exchange of fistbumps occur, a chat window is created and new friendships can be found through PepRally.
