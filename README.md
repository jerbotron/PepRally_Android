# PepRally Android App

PepRally is a fun social media network dedicated to college students that aims to improve the student-life experience. By creating a niche environment unique to your campus, we help you interact directly with other students and student athletes around you. You can share news about campus events, seek advice on how to pass your finals, get hyped for the big game and most importantly - stay in the know with filtered social media content that actually matters to you!

See a post that you like? Fistbump it!
